â€‹Optimal Approach
To handle all cases correctly, consider the following:




Split the Problem:
Rob the first house and not the last house (so, consider nums[0] to nums[n-2]).
Rob the last house and not the first house (so, consider nums[1] to nums[n-1]).
Use Dynamic Programming:
For each scenario, use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum of money that can be robbed from a linear arrangement of houses (ignoring the circular aspect).




Explanation:
robLinear Function: This function computes the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from a linear sequence of houses using dynamic programming.
rob Function: This function handles the circular nature of the problem by splitting it into two cases, robbing from the first to the second last house and robbing from the second to the last house, and then returns the maximum value from both cases.
