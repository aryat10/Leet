â€‹# Jump Game Problem - Optimized Greedy Approach

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, where each element represents your maximum jump length at that position, return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

## Approach: Greedy Method

### Key Concepts
- **Greedy Strategy**: At each index, update the farthest index that can be reached. If at any point, the current index is beyond this maximum reach, return `false`.
- **Early Exit**: If at any index, the farthest reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index, return `true` immediately.

### Steps
1. **Initialize `maxI`**: 
   - Start with `maxI = 0`, representing the maximum index that can be reached so far.

2. **Iterate Through Array**:
   - For each index `i`, check:
     - If `i > maxI`, return `false`, as it means the current index cannot be reached.
     - Update `maxI` as the maximum of the current `maxI` and `i + nums[i]` (farthest index that can be reached from index `i`).
     - If `maxI >= nums.size() - 1`, return `true`, as the last index can be reached.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If the loop completes without returning, the last index is reachable, so return `true`.

### Example Dry Run
- **Input**: `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
- **Steps**:
   - Start with `maxI = 0`.
   - At `i = 0`, update `maxI = max(0, 2 + 0) = 2`.
   - At `i = 1`, update `maxI = max(2, 3 + 1) = 4`.
   - Since `maxI >= nums.size() - 1`, return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`. Each element is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional space is required beyond a few variables.

## Conclusion
The optimized greedy approach efficiently determines whether the last index is reachable by tracking the maximum reachable index at each step and allows for early exits when the last index is guaranteed to be reachable.
